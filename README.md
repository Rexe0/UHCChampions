# UHCChampions
UHCChampions is a small add-on plugin to UHCCore which attempts to recreate some items and mechanics from Hypixel's UHC Champions. Some items added aren't the exact same as the ones in Hypixel while some are completely new and not in Hypixel at all. In order to fully utilise this plugin, you must also download the relevant crafts.yml and kits.yml from the official UHCCore discord server. Because this plugin was originally created for private use only, there are no customization options or config files associated with this plugin and so you can not change anything within it as of now. If you really would like something to change, you can either ask me or contribute the code yourself.

# Code Usage
You can pretty much use this code freely as the project is open source. However, do not pass or publish any of this code as your own and give credit to me if you do indeed use it elsewhere.
